We would like to make these instructions as general as possible. First, install neovim from the github.
First, download the repo into some location
	git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim/
	cd neovim

We then want to install it, the instructions are in the readme for neovim but the standard install is
	make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
	sudo make install

Then we want to install the configuration files. We do this by placing this repository into the ~/.config/ folder

Then, by calling nvim, it should install all the plugins. Note, we want to install clang to parse the C++ code so we use command
	:LspInstall clangd
inside the vim window
